# Infrared

PoC Gem idea. Make a Ruby ActiveSupport/DB Adpater to expose Ghost like
an API. Thought it might be nice to use Ghost as your marketing/simple
CMS and integrate into more custom site. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'infrared'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:
